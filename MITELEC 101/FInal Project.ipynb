    "## Final Project Progress 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scenario**\n",
    "- Environment: Classic Pac-Man maze (grid with walls, pellets, and power pellets).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents: 3 Pac-Man players (autonomous agents, not ghosts). Each has a goal to collect points by eating pellets and staying alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conflict: Certain critical routes (corridors) must be shared. If two or more agents attempt to take the same corridor simultaneously, they clash and one may be forced to wait or reroute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenge: Agents must negotiate rights of way or synchronize traversal of shared routes to stay in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Required Features**\n",
    "1. **Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Maze grid with walls, pellets, and “shared route” corridors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Pac-Men can move up, down, left, right (no diagonal).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each agent has an energy bar or score counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - They collect pellets for points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If they fail to resolve conflicts properly, they “stall” or lose points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Negotiation & Conflict Resolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When two or more agents want the same corridor at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Negotiation: Agents propose who goes first (e.g., based on score, random lottery, or alternating offers).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Conflict Resolution: If no agreement, apply fallback (priority rule, penalty, or random arbitration).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Synchronization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If multiple agents need to coordinate traversal (e.g., crossing intersection), they can synchronize by token passing or barrier synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Win/Survival Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Agents must keep collecting pellets while resolving conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An agent “drops out” if it repeatedly fails to negotiate or loses too much energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Winner is the one with the highest score after all pellets are consumed or a time limit ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metrics to Record**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of conflicts detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of successful negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average waiting time per agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fairness in access to shared routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total score per agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extended Work (optional)**\n",
    "- Add ghosts back into the game: agents must also synchronize/coordinate to avoid them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-issue negotiation: trade route access in exchange for pellets in another area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning strategies: agents adapt their negotiation tactics over time.\n",
    "\n"
